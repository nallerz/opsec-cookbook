# Aerial Observation
## Summary
Aerial observation encompasses a vast set of capabilities in the intelligence and counter intelligence space. This is not limited to military and government aircraft, as a lot can be learned from the activity patterns of civilian aircraft and the airspace in general.

Defensively, It is very difficult to conceal activities from aerial assets, and depending on the technology employed, certain indoor activities can also be compromised by aerial observation. Examples include monitoring facility use patterns, thermal imaging, multispectral imaging, and deployment of additional surveillance systems.

Offensively, i.e. using drones or aircraft to observe activity can provide valuable information on activity, images of secure areas, patterns of activity, 

This chapter will be split into 2 sections:
