# Chapter 1: Opsec Concepts
## Summary
Opsec or operational security, is ensuring that you are able to continue operations without the enemy, or anyone you do not intend, gathering intelligence that could compromise your short or long term objectives.

This concept was coloqialised in the simple but profound world war ii phrase "loose lips sinks ships". Good opsec requires that threats to security/privacy be evaluated, an countered. This of course comes at a cost on some level. See more info on building a threat model.
## Always watching, always listening
You should always assume an adversary, threat, or even allies are attempting to observe your actions. Being decisive and conscientious of when/what you are ok with sharing, and when/what you are not ok with sharing is important.

There are many ways you can be observed, and it is critical that one does not underestimate the determination and abilities of adversaries.
## Tradeoffs
There is no perfect opsec. Everything is a tradeoff between security/effectiveness, convenience, efficiency, cost, and other factors.
