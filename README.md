# opsec-cookbook
Lowering the barrier of entry for those interested in using privacy-preserving tools

## Project Goals
- help users understand and evaluate opsec & privacy threats
- maintain a repository of procedures, techniques, protocols, etc. for enhancing operational security, privacy, and secure communication
- provide "toolkits" which allow one to quickly assemble and deploy hardware and/or software bundles that provide relevant features for the intended use case
- allow the community to productize/democratize privacy tools and technology that have traditionally required deep domain expertise across multiple domains (i.e. too time consuming/inconvenient/inaccessible for a reasonable person to successfully implement)

## Contribution & Use Guidelines
The topics of opsec, privacy, and communications is quite broad. These concepts can be applied in a civilian, intelligence, military, and/or many other contexts. 

At this time, this scope is not limited to any one use case, however most content will likely be contributed and organized in the context of civilian and open source intelligence use cases. 

*Contributors are welcome [and needed!] from many areas of domain expertise.*

Check out some of the [guiding principles](https://github.com/nallerz/opsec-cookbook/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for the project if you would like to learn more.

## Content
There are two main types of resources here to support the community. 

### 1. The Library
The Library is a knowledge base for opsec theory, best practices, general threat intelligence, and methods/techniques/countermeasures/features. The Library is divided into volumes on different topics. Check out the [table of contents](https://github.com/nallerz/opsec-cookbook/blob/main/library/library_readme.md#table-of-contents) for more details.


### 2. Toolkits
Toolkits can be thought of as loadouts or builds that offer various features discussed in the library.
Toolkits are intended to package related features/solutions/countermeasures into user friendly kits that don't require deep multi-domain knowledge)
