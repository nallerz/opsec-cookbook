# opsec-cookbook
Lowering the barrier of entry for those interested in using privacy-preserving tools

## Project Goals
- help users understand and evaluate opsec & privacy threats
- maintain a repository of procedures, techniques, protocols, etc. for enhancing operational security, privacy, and secure communication
- provide "toolkits" which allow one to quickly assemble and deploy hardware and/or software bundles that provide relevant features for the intended use case
- allow the community to productize/democratize privacy tools and technology that have traditionally required deep domain expertise across multiple domains (i.e. too time consuming/inconvenient/inaccessible for a reasonable person to successfully implement)

## Contribution & Use Guidelines
The topics of opsec, privacy, and communications is quite broad. These concepts can be applied in a civilian, intelligence, military, and/or many other contexts. 

At this time, this scope is not limited to any one use case, however most content will likely be contributed and organized in the context of civilian and open source intelligence use cases. 

*Contributors are welcome [and needed!] from many areas of domain expertise.*
